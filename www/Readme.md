## Framework7 and Parse


Example web application built with [Framework7](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/#.VSRQUovF87Y) HTML5 mobile web framework and powered by [Parse.com](http://www.parse.com) for user account data storage.

Application implements user registration and user login funcionality by communicating with Parse cloud service.

You can find step by step tutorial about creating this mobile web application on [HTMLCenter Blog](http://www.htmlcenter.com/blog/html5-frameworks-for-mobile-web-applications/). It describes how I have built this source code from ground up.

In order to get Parse.com connection working you will have to register on their site and get your own applicationId and API key. Once you retrieve them - go to `my-app.js` add them in the section marked `@TODO Parse.com credentials`
